> This page is part of the [Hello Deep Learning](../hello-deep-learning) series of blog posts.

Placeholder page. Will mostly be an homage to the essential [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).

Includes a demo trained on my blog posts that writes pretty plausible sentences.

Also a demo of how Gated Recurring Units can spot splice junctions in DNA.

In [the next chapter](../dl-what-does-it-all-mean) you can find some philosophizing about what deep learning all means, analogies to biology and what the future might hold.
