Placeholder page. Will mostly an hommage to the essential [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).

Includes a demo trained on my blog posts that writes pretty plausible sentences.

Also a demo of how Gated Recurring Units can spot splice junctions in DNA.

TBC
